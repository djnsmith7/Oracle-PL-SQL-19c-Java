# Oracle_19c_SQL_Server_and_Java_Complete_Project
This is my Oracle 19c, SQL Server, and Java project where I have showcased my skillsets within SQL * Plus, SQL Developer, SQL Server, and Eclipse environments.  I created the fictitious data presented and used it to present the following skillset components:  Entity tables, supported by primary and foreign keys, a dynamic stored procedure, a function, a call to the function, AES 192 encryption, a DBMS_Scheduler, a package, a statistical data snapshot, and a call to the statistical data snapshot.
